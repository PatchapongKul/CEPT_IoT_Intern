# Smart Air Condition Control

## 🧭 Overview

Traditional air conditioner (AC) systems are typically controlled via:
- **Infrared (IR) remote controllers**, or
- **Mobile applications** that communicate through the vendor's cloud service.

In both cases, the command path involves multiple layers — from the user to the cloud, and then back to the AC’s internal Wi-Fi module. This indirect method introduces latency and dependency on internet connectivity and vendor APIs.

To integrate air conditioning units into a local **Energy Management System (EMS)** for grid load control, a faster and more reliable control method is required. This project aims to:

- **Bypass the cloud**, allowing direct local control of AC units over a local network (LAN)
- **Interface EMS with ACs** to stabilize the power grid based on real-time energy data
- Use an **ESP32 microcontroller** to receive commands and forward them to the AC via **UART**
- Optionally provide a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for manual user control

## 📘 Study Guideline

To effectively implement and maintain the system, the following questions and topics should be studied:

### 1. ❄️ Controllable Parameters of Carrier XInverter AC
- What parameters can be **controlled or monitored** via the physical remote or mobile application?
- What is the **"POWER-SELECTION"** feature?
  - What levels can be set?
  - How does changing this setting affect the AC’s performance and energy consumption?

### 2. 📱 Mobile Application Integration
- How does the AC unit pair with the **official mobile application**?
- What **credentials** are required to link the app with the AC unit?

### 3. ⚡ EMS Load Control Purpose
- Why does an **Energy Management System (EMS)** need to control the AC load?
- What are the typical scenarios in which the EMS should intervene to limit power consumption, and when should it allow full user control of the AC?

### 4. 🌐 Networking Basics
- What is the difference between a **public** and **private network**?
- Why should control communication be kept within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**?
- What network settings must be configured so that the **EMS server** and **ESP32 device** can discover and communicate with each other?

### 5. 🔐 Access Control Design
- What is **access control**, and why is it important in local systems?
- What access control strategy should be applied in this system?
- How to prevent unauthorized control or misuse of the AC unit?

### 6. 🔧 UART Basics
- What is **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)**?
- What are key features and key configurations

### 7. 🚏 API Route Design
- Based on the available commands, how should the API be structured?

### 8. 🔄 System Data Flow Design
- How does data move between the system components? **user or EMS** → **API server** → **ESP32** → **AC unit**
